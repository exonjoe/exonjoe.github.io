    </div>
    <p>I was initially brought on for a 4 month contract, to create a price comparison website for business energy brokers. I alone designed and programmed the front-end, and continue to maintain the site. After this, I was brought on as a permanent employee, and have primarily worked on a CRM system for business energy brokers. I have been the lead designer and developer on this project since its inception in late 2015, and have been responsible for its design, working on both the front and back ends. The system was released in early 2016, and I have been involved in ongoing maintenance and development since then. I have also worked on a domestic energy savings calculator, and a bespoke in-house network security app. I've gained experience with working in a team, and leading a project. I've made use of HTML5, CSS3, JS, C#.NET, SQL and TFS.</p>
    <p>In November 2016, I was designated the supervisor to a junior developer. I have been in charge of training and managing this developer, and allocating work to him, while also assisting him in his own independent time management and self-education. The process has given me an insight into leadership, and offered me increased responsibility.</p>

    <p>As Exon’s sole employee, I have been responsible for: finding clients; discussing their needs for website development, hosting and maintenance; drafting contracts; developing websites using HTML, PHP and CSS, and more occasionally making use of JS, jQuery, ASP.NET and SQL; securing domain names and hosting for client websites; taking and editing photographs; recording and editing videos; image editing; logo creation; and working with existing code.</p>

    <p>I had an internship at Metaswitch, during which time I was tasked with developing a diagnostics tool for a piece of network infrastructure hardware. My work required me to learn about Linux, and involved use of Python. I gained experience in working with existing code, unit testing, programming to a set of standards, and making presentations.</p>

    <p>On and off since 2007, I have volunteered my services for Vertigo Gaming Inc, providing quality assurance for around seven games. For the company’s latest game, <em>Cook, Serve, Delicious!</em>, in addition to my regular QA duties, I offered my services as a writer. As of November 2016, the game has <a href="http://www.steamspy.com/app/247020">over 400,000 owners</a>, and has grossed in excess of 1 million USD.</p>
